# Bonjour! I'm Loïc Legroux 👋

Hello, I'm a young data scientist from France. I've always been interested by new technologies and decided to work in AI after finding about how interesting that field is!
I also sometimes compete on Kaggle when I find the time therefore some of my work can be found here.  
  
This GitHub profile will mainly showcase student or personal projects ✨

## I really enjoy listening to music 🎵
