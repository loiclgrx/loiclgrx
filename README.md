# Bonjour! I'm Loïc Legroux 👋

Hello, I'm a young data scientist from France. I've always been interested by new tech and decided to work in AI after finding about how interesting that field is!
I also sometimes compete on Kaggle when I find the time.  
  
This GitHub profile will mainly showcase student or personal projects ✨
